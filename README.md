Single-Page CV

This project is an implementation of the "Single-Page CV" challenge from roadmap.sh. The goal was to build a curriculum vitae using only HTML, focusing on semantic structure and a clear, readable layout. The project emphasizes proper HTML semantics, accessibility, and basic SEO practices, preparing the page for future styling with CSS.

The implementation includes semantic HTML elements throughout the document, SEO meta tags, Open Graph tags for better social media sharing, and a linked favicon. The page follows a single-page structure containing personal information, skills, education, professional experience, and links to online profiles. No CSS or JavaScript was used, as required by the challenge.

This project serves as a foundation for practicing semantic markup and clean structure. The next step will be applying CSS to improve visual design, layout, and responsiveness. To view the result, simply open the index.html file in a browser.
